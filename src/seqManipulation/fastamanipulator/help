Fasta Alignment Manipulator
  Manipulate MSA with the command line.

Usage:
  java -jar fam.jar <Options>   or
  fam.jar <Otions>
  
Options: -infile            : Is the input fasta file (or stdin if no present).
         -outfile           : Is the path to the output file (or stdout if no 
                               present).

                               sequences to be retrieved is required.
                               The first sequence i s the number 1.

         -length            : Counts the number of columns in the alignment. 
                               If all of them haven't the same size return 0.
         -lengths           : Counts the number of columns in each row 
                               of the alignment.

                               sequence.
         -append            : Creates a new alignment from two. Each sequences 
                               of the new alignment results of the combination

                               same row. The two input alignment should have the
                               same number of rows.
                               Example:
