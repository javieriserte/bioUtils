Gapstripper.

  This program is intended to perform three common pre-processing
  features in alignments before MI calculation.
 
   * Maximum frequency filter.
   * Strip with a reference sequence.
   * Remove rows (sequences) with more than a given fraction of gaps.
 
Usage:
  gapstripper.jar <Options>  
 
Options:
  --infile      Path file to input alignment. If omitted standard input is used.
  --outfile     Path file to output alignment. If omitted standard output 
                is used.
  --maxfreq     Real number. Keeps the columns whose maximum frequency is less 
                than or equal to a given value. If omitted all positions are 
                included.
  --refId       String. Sets reference sequence by its title or description.
  --refNum      Integer. Sets reference sequence by the position in the 
                alignment. The counting starts with 1, not zero.
                If neither --refId or --refNum are indicated, then stripping
                is not performed. 
  --gapsInRows  Real Number. Removes rows whose gap fraction is more than or 
                equal to a given value. If omitted, 0.5 is used. 
  --ref_file    Path File to out reference map file. If omitted reference is not
                printed.
