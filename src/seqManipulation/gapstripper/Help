Gapstripper.

  This program is intended to perform three common pre-processing
  features in alignments before MI calculation.
 
   * Maximum frequency filter.
   * Strip with a reference sequence.
   * Remove rows (sequences) with more than a given fraction of gaps.
 
Usage:
  gapstripper.jar <Options>  
 
Options:
  --infile      Path file to input alignment. If omitted standard input is used.
  
  --outfile     Path file to output alignment. If omitted standard output 
                is used.
                
  --maxfreq     Real number. Keeps the columns whose maximum frequency is less 
                than or equal to a given value. If omitted all positions are 
                included.
                
  --refId       String. Sets reference sequence by its title or description.
  
  --refNum      Integer. Sets reference sequence by the position in the 
                alignment. The counting starts with 1, not zero.
                If neither --refId or --refNum are indicated, then stripping
                is not performed. 
                
  --gapsInRows  Real Number. Removes rows whose gap fraction is more than or 
                equal to a given value. If omitted, 0.5 is used. Zero is treated 
                as a special value, and only are accepted value without any gap.
                (comparison by equals is overridden). This is to try to respect
                the original implementation.
                 
  --ref_file    Path File to out reference map file. If omitted reference is not
                printed. The first column is the position in the output alignment,
		        the second column is the corresponding position in the original
		        alignment.
		        
  --cluster     Perform clustering before maximum frequency filter. By defult, 
                clustering is not performed.
                
  --clusterId   Real Number. Identity fraction threshold for sequence clustering. 
                By default 0.62 is used.
