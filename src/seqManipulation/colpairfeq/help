ColPairFreq. 0.2.1

  This program reads an alignment, and a series of position pairs an returns 
  the amino acid pairs in those positions and the frequency of appearance of 
  each pair.  
 
Usage:
  colpairfreq.jar <Options>  
 
Options:
  --infile      Path file to input alignment. If omitted standard input is used.
  
  --outfile     Path file to output text. If omitted standard output is used.
                
  --list_file   File. Is the path to a file containing the position pairs to 
                analyze. Each text line of the file correspond to a single pair. 
                Numbers in each line should be separated by a space or tab char.
                Position numbers starts in 1, not 0. 
                
  --positions   Integer. A list of comma separated values that correspond to 
                columns in the alignment (starting in 1, not 0). The list must 
                have a even number of elements. First and second elements 
                correspond to the first pair, third and fourth correspond to
                the second pair, etc.              
                
  --help        Flag. Shows this help and exit.
