Conservation Image Generator.
  Creates conservation plots from multiple sequence alignments.
  Input alignment must be in Fasta format.
  
  Two methods for conservation calculus are available:
     1. Informative content (Max. Shannon entropy - column Shannon entropy).
     2. Clustal conservation symbols ('*' = 1, ':' = 0.5, '.' = 0.25, ' ' = 0.0).
  
  There are two of kind of graphics available:
     1. Standard (x,y) plot.
     2. Vertical bars with differential coloring. 

  Usage: 
    java -jar ConservationImage.jar <Options>

  Example:
    java -jar ConservationImage.jar --infile myAlignment.fas --outfile plot.jpg --window 15 --layout LINES --color LIGHTREDBLUE

  Options:
    --infile <path>         Input multiple sequence alignment.
    --outfile <path>        Output 'jpg' file.
    --window <number>       Smoothing window width. Window is equal to 11 by default.
    --protein               Indicate that the alignment contain protein sequences.
                            DNA sequences are assumed by default.
    --ic                    Calculate informative content.
                            Clustal conservation method is default.
    --layout <string>       Indicate the graphics style of the output image.
                            String can contain a path to a file containing the
                            layout parameters or:
                             1. 'XY'     for standard (x,y) plot.
                             2. 'LINES'  for colored vertical bars.
                            By default (x,y) plot is used.
    --countgap              Count gaps '-' as another symbol for frequencies
                            calculation. By default gaps are ignored.
    --nodraw                Do not generates output image. Useful for only export
                            profile values.
    --export                Indicates than data must be exported.
    --path                  Sets the out file export data. Standard output is used
                            by default.
    --color                 Coloring method used. Three different kind of 
                            coloring methods are supported:
                             1. 'LIGHTREDBLUE'  for light red to blue gradient.   
                             2. 'REDBLUE'       for red to blue gradient.
                             3. 'BLACK'         for uniform black (Use it only 
                                                with (x,y) plots).
                            By default red to blue gradient is used.
    --help                  Shows this help.
