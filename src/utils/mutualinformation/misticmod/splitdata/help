Split Mi Data.
	 Split a file of intra/inter protein MI data in three set of data. Two 
	 for each intra MI data sets and one for inter protein MI data.
	 This assumes that the calculation was made using an joint alignment of
	 two proteins. The length of the first protein must be passed to properly
	 split the data. Also, is assumed that the first index of the data is 1,
	 not 0. 
	 
Usage:
  misplitter.jar <Options>  
 
Options:
  --infile          String. Path file to input MI Data. If omitted standard 
                    input is used.
  
  --out             List of String. Must contain three string, each one is the
                    path of an output file. The first correspond to first 
                    intra mi data set. The second correspond to the second mi
                    data set. And the last one correspond to the inter protein
                    mi data. Each path must be separated by a comma.

  --cut             Integer. Is the length of the first protein. Residues from
                    1 to this value correspond to the first protein. From this 
                    value plus one to the end correspond to the second protein.
  
  --help            Shows this help.
