Interprotein CMI Circos generator.
  Creates the configuration files for Circos representing the MI interprotein
  data.

Usage:
  CmiToCircos.jar <Options>

Options:
  -infile           Path file to input MI data file. If omitted standard input 
                    is used.
  
  -prefix           String. Prefixes in file names generated to be used in 
                    circos.

  -countall         Flag. If present, the Cmi between two proteins is normalized
                    by the product of the lengths of both proteins, regardless
                    that many positions sum 0 to Cmi.
                    If absent, the Cmi between two proteins is normalized by the
                    number of pairs that have a value greater then 0 (usually,
                    greater than 6.5, but this is not verified).
                
  -lengths          List of Integer. The length of each protein, separated by a
                    comma. Protein lengths must have the same order than the MI
                    data file. 
                    
  -names            Path to a file with the names of each region or protein.
                    
  -pngdir           Path to the directory where png files should be exported by  circos.
  
  -help             Shows this help.
