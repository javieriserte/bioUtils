Interprotein CMI calculator.
  Calculates an weighted sum of MI between all pairs of residues of protein
  pairs.

Usage:
  cmi_ip.jar <Options>

Options:
  -infile           Path file to input MI data file. If omitted standard input 
                    is used.
  
  -outfile          Output file path. If omitted standard output is used. 

  -countall         Flag. If present, the Cmi between two proteins is normalized
                    by the product of the lengths of both proteins, regardless
                    that many positions sum 0 to Cmi.
                    If absent, the Cmi between two proteins is normalized by the
                    number of pairs that have a value greater then 0 (usually,
                    greater than 6.5, but this is not verified).
                
  -lengths          List of Integer. The length of each protein, separated by a
                    comma. Protein lengths must have the same order than the MI
                    data file. 
                    
  -names            List of String. The name of each protein, separated by a 
                    comma.
                    
  -table            Flag. Indicates that the output must be print as a table.
  
  -help             Shows this help.
