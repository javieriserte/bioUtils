 ReconstructMI - Creates a MI data file from several files.
 
 Reads several MI_Data files and creates one that contains all the data.  Given 
 a data set of N proteins (each protein is Pi, with 0 < i <= N), the program 
 reads (N*(N+1)) files of MI data between all proteins, including every protein 
 with itself (each MI data file corresponds to MI(P_i,P_j), with j >= i). Files 
 must given in the right order, for data files for MI(P_i,P_j):
   1. index j >= index i.
   2. first, order by i index.
   3. then, order data sets with the same index i, with the index j.
    
 Residue enumeration for both proteins in every data file must start with 1.
 The first residue of every MI pair must correspond to P_i, and the second to 
 P_j, for a data file of MI(P_i,P_j).
 
 Usage: 
   reconstructmi.jar <Option>
  
 Options:
   --files    List of Strings. Paths to all MI data files, separated by comma.
              The files must be given in the right order.
                
   --outfile  String. Path to the resulting mi data file.

   --lengths  List of Integer. A list with the length of every protein. The 
              values must be given in order, corresponding to the order in 
              --files option.  
    
   --help    Shows this help and exit.
